3D Wireless Network Simulator README

Introduction

This 3D Wireless Network Simulator is a powerful educational and experimental tool that allows users to observe the behavior of wireless signals in a dynamic, three-dimensional environment.

This simulator uses a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) based approach to depict spectral efficiency, modulation, and coding rate, offering a deeper understanding of the concepts involved in wireless network communications.

Features

Dynamic 3D visualization: Depicts the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) as a set of three-dimensional cubes, providing a unique visual approach to understanding wireless signals.
SNR-Based Modulation and Coding: The application uses SNR to compute and display Spectral Efficiency, Modulation, and Coding Rate.
Interactive: Clicking on the displayed cubes toggles a detailed display of the SNR and other pertinent data.
How to Use

Open the application in your web browser.
The 3D simulation will automatically start, presenting a grid of cubes that represent different SNR values.
Click on any cube to reveal detailed information about its SNR, spectral efficiency, modulation, and coding rate.
